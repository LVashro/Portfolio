			<li>1. The Useless Web
				<p class="list_desc">I used to play with this website all the time.
				This website will send you to random useless websites in the internet,
				if you click the button </br>on the middle. My favorite thing about this 
				website is that all the website you will be taken to... is all useless as heck.
				You will love it.

			<li>2. Bored Button
				<p class="list_desc">This is the site my friend told about it to me when
				I was just creating this website. If you click the red button on the top,
				it will send</br> you to random website for you to enjoy. Unlike The Useless web, all the sites
				this site sends you to, are not useless! They are all </br>entertaining in many ways.

			<li>3. Is my computer on fire
				<p class="list_desc"></br>This website was always there to tell me if my 
				computer was on fire. Is your computer is on fire? Go to this site to 
				check, just in case.
