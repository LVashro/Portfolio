		<p>This is the STEM project poster with all the infomation of what I really did.
		It was a very simple, Python program which will encode any message you enter and
		also decode it on users will.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Like I said, the program is very simple. The encryption used in this program
		is completely homemade. If the message is entererd, this program will just convert
		all the letters to their Unicodes, and then I add 91 to it. When its decoding
		it does the opposite. It subtracts the number</p>
		</br>
		<p>If this sounds too complicated and you don't understand the word I've wrote,
		please Google it. Thanks much.</p>
